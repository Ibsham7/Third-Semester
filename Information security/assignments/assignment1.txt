Task: For columnar transposition, write code to:
a. encrypt the message “Believe you can and you are halfway there”. Key: GREAT
b. decrypt the ciphertext generated in part (a).
Attach the code for part (a), (b) and screenshots of output (for both encryption and decryption)
in the submission document.
Explanation of Columnar Transposition:
1. Key Selection: A keyword or key phrase is chosen to determine the order in which the
columns will be read.
2. Grid Formation: The plaintext message is written into a grid row by row, with the number
of columns determined by the length of the keyword. If the plaintext does not perfectly fit
the grid, extra spaces or padding characters may be added.
3. Column Rearrangement: The columns of the grid are then rearranged according to the
alphabetical order of the letters in the keyword. If a letter appears more than once in the
keyword, only the first occurrence is considered for the sorting.
4. Ciphertext Formation: The ciphertext is generated by reading the columns of the grid in
the order determined by the sorted keyword.
5. Transmission or Storage: The ciphertext can then be transmitted or stored securely
